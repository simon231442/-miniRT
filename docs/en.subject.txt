Chapter I
Introduction
When it comes to rendering three-dimensional computer-generated images, there are two
possible approaches: “Rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphics engines because of its efficiency, and “Ray Tracing.”
The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon
since), is still more computationally expensive than the “Rasterization” method. As
a result, it is not yet fully adapted to real-time use cases but it produces a much higher
degree of visual realism.

Figure I.1: The pictures above are rendered with the ray tracing technique. Impressive, isn’t it?
Before you can even begin to produce such high-quality graphics, you must master the
basics: the miniRT is your first ray tracer coded in C, normed, humble, but functional.
The main goal of miniRT is to prove to yourself that you can implement any mathematical or physical formulas without being a mathematician. We will only implement
the most basic ray tracing features here, so just keep calm, take a deep breath, and don’t
panic! After this project, you will be able to show off nice-looking pictures to justify
the number of hours you are spending at school.

Common Instructions
• Your project must be written in C.
• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check, and you will receive a 0 if
there is a norm error.
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior. If this occurs, your project will be
considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks
will not be tolerated.
• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source
files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.
• Your Makefile must contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.
• To submit bonuses for your project, you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless
the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is
conducted separately.
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your project’s Makefile must compile
the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work
does not need to be submitted and will not be graded. It will give you an
opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find these tests
especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use
your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to the assigned Git repository. Only the work in the Git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will occur

after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

Chapter III
AI Instructions
● Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to
explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. However, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it’s
code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure
that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers
are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.

● Main message
☛ Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
☛ Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit your
future career.
☛ Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,
and ethical issues.
☛ Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛ Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility
for.

● Learner rules:
• You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so
you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
• You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write clearer,
more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
• You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning,
and testing anything generated by AI.
• You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.

● Phase outcomes:
• Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
• Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
• Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and
collaboration.

● Comments and examples:
• You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where
you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your
technical and interpersonal skills.
• Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your understanding. Make peer learning a priority.
• AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your
peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
• Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alternative perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.
✓ Good practice:
I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. I try them out
and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
✗ Bad practice:
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peerevaluation, I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail my
project.
✓ Good practice:
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch
two bugs and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
✗ Bad practice:
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t
explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my
project.

Description

Yes
The goal of your program is to generate
images using the Raytracing protocol. Those
computer-generated images will each represent a
scene, as seen from a specific angle and position,
defined by simple geometric objects, and each with
its own lighting system.

The constraints are as follows:
• You must use the miniLibX library, either the version that is available on the
operating system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you
will need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.
• The management of your window must remain fluid: switching to another window,

minimization, etc.
• You need at least these three simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.
• If applicable, all possible intersections and the insides of the objects must be handled
correctly.
• Your program must be able to resize the unique properties of objects: diameter for
a sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
• Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformations to
objects, lights, and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
• Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambient lighting (objects are
never completely in the dark). You must implement ambient and diffuse lighting.
• The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
◦ Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
◦ Clicking on the red cross on the window frame must close the window and quit
the program cleanly.
◦ The use of images from the minilibX library is strongly recommended.
• Your program must take as its first argument a scene description file with the .rt
extension.
◦ Each type of element can be separated by one or more line breaks.
◦ Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more
spaces.
◦ Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
◦ Elements defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in the scene.

◦ The first piece of information for each element is the type identifier (composed
of one or two characters), followed by all specific information for each object
in a strict order such as:

• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit
properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
• For the defense, it would be ideal for you to have a whole set of scenes focused on
what is functional, to facilitate the control of the elements to create.

Chapter V
Bonus part
The Ray-Tracing technique could handle many more things like reflection, transparency,
refraction, more complex objects, soft shadows, caustics, global illumination, bump mapping, .obj file rendering, etc.
But for the miniRT project, we want to keep things simple for your first ray tracer and
your first steps in CGI.
Here is a list of a few simple bonuses you could implement. If you want to do bigger
bonuses, we strongly advise you to recode a new ray tracer later in your developer life
after this little one is finished and fully functional.

Figure V.1: A spot, a space skybox, and a shiny earth-textured sphere with bumpmapping

12

miniRT

Bonuses will be evaluated only if your mandatory part is perfect.
By perfect we naturally mean that it needs to be complete, that it
cannot fail, even in cases of nasty mistakes like wrong uses, etc.
It means that if your mandatory part does not obtain all the points
during the grading, your bonuses will be entirely ignored.

Bonus list:
• Add specular reflection to achieve a full Phong reflection model.
• Color disruption: checkerboard pattern.
• Colored and multi-spot lights.
• One other second-degree object: cone, hyperboloid, paraboloid..
• Handle bump map textures.

You are allowed to use other functions and add features to your
scene description to complete the bonus part, as long as their use is
justified during your evaluation. You are also allowed to modify the
expected scene file format to fit your needs. Be smart!

Chapter VII
Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double-check the names of
your files to ensure they are correct.
During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or
rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
While this step may not be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it
if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.
This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g.,
your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific
timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation.
You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.
The details (scope, target, etc.) will be specified in the evaluation guidelines and may
vary from one evaluation to another for the same project.
